## 1. Current PFC variant support matrix

`PfcTopologyVariants` (MAS schema, 10 values). Status after this work:

| Variant | Sizing/waveforms | Switching netlist + PtP | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| BOOST | ✅ | ✅ | baseline |
| BRIDGELESS | ✅ | ✅ | inductor ≡ boost (series, rectified side) |
| SEMI_BRIDGELESS | ✅ | ✅ | inductor ≡ boost |
| INTERLEAVED_BOOST | ✅ (per-phase) | ✅ (per-phase cell) | `numberOfPhases` ∈ {2,3} |
| TOTEM_POLE | ✅ (bipolar waveform) | ✅ (bipolar 4-switch stage) | CCM requires `wideBandgapSwitch=true` |
| SEPIC | ✅ (analytical, CCM/CrCM) | ❌ throws | buck-boost class; DCM rejected |
| CUK | ✅ (analytical, CCM/CrCM) | ❌ throws | buck-boost class; DCM rejected |
| BUCK | ❌ throws | ❌ | discontinuous input current — no series-L path |
| BUCK_BOOST | ❌ throws | ❌ | discontinuous input current |
| VIENNA | ❌ throws | ❌ | 3-phase/3-level; own model — see VIENNA_PLAN.md |

"Throws" everywhere is a *loud, specific* exception (CLAUDE.md: no silent
fallbacks). Every variant either works or refuses with a precise reason.

### Key design split (read this before extending)
- **Boost family** (boost/bridgeless/semi-bridgeless/interleaved): the series
  inductor sits on the rectified side and sees `+Vin` during ON, `Vin−Vout`
  during OFF → identical boost sizing `L = Vin·D/(ΔI·fsw)` and the SAME
  switching netlist (`generate_ngspice_switching_circuit`). Interleaved emits
  ONE per-phase cell (`per_phase_power` = Pout/N, per-phase L).
- **Totem-pole** (bridgeless, bipolar): same boost sizing, but the inductor is
  on the AC side and carries SIGNED current. `generate_ngspice_switching_circuit`
  has a `bipolar` branch (selected for TOTEM_POLE) emitting a genuine 4-switch
  stage: a floating line source `B_vac` between `vac` and the LF-leg midpoint
  `mid_lf`; an HF leg (`S_hf_hi`/`S_hf_lo` + rectifying diodes `D_hf_hi`/
  `D_hf_lo`) where ONE switch is the active boost switch and the OPPOSITE leg's
  diode rectifies — roles swap by line polarity; and a line-frequency LF leg
  (`S_lf_hi`/`S_lf_lo`) routing the AC return to gnd (positive half) or vbus
  (negative half). Only one switch + one diode conduct at any instant, so it
  converges like the boost. The controller is REUSED verbatim (same
  `derive_pfc_controller_tuning`, type-II EAs, warm-start) but runs in the
  rectified domain: it senses `|i_L|` (`abs(I(Vl_sense))`), the multiplier
  reference is on `|vline|`, and a polarity selector (`pol_pos`) ROUTES the
  single PWM command to the active HF switch + drives the LF leg. This is how
  industry totem-pole average-current controllers actually work — no separate
  bipolar controller was needed.
- **Buck-boost class** (SEPIC/Ćuk): `is_buck_boost_class()` in the header.
  Series input inductor (continuous input current) but buck-boost conversion:
  `D = (Vout+Vd)/(Vin+Vout+Vd)` (see `calculate_duty_cycle`), L1 sees `+Vin`
  ON (so the boost L formula is shared) but `−(Vout+Vd)` OFF. Handled in all
  THREE synthesis loops (`process_operating_points`,
  `simulate_and_extract_waveforms`, `simulate_and_extract_topology_waveforms`).
- Anything with **discontinuous input current** (buck, buck-boost) has no
  shared series-inductor path → not supported.

## 2. Deferred work — what's left, why, and how to do it

### 2a. Totem-pole switching PtP  ✅ DONE (2026-05-29)
Implemented as the `bipolar` branch of `generate_ngspice_switching_circuit`
(see the "Totem-pole" bullet in §1). Key outcome vs the original plan: a
**separate bipolar controller was NOT needed** — the average-current loop runs
in the rectified domain (senses `|i_L|`, multiplier on `|vline|`) and a
line-polarity selector routes the single PWM command to the active HF switch,
exactly as industry totem-pole controllers do. The genuine 4-switch stage
(floating source + HF leg with role-swapped active-switch/diode + LF polarity
leg) converged on the first attempt with the existing PFC solver settings (only
one switch + one diode conduct at a time, so it's boost-like numerically).
PtP: `TestPfcReferenceDesignsPtp.cpp` "Totem-pole 100 W" — envelope gate
compares against the SIGNED sine; input-port check uses a zero-mean bipolar
line (`check_pfc_switching_ports(..., bipolarInput=true)`, fed `v(vline)`).
Sim wall-time ≈ 10 s, bus lands ~382 V (−4.5 %, inside ±6 %), all gates pass.

### 2b. SEPIC/Ćuk switching PtP  (highest value remaining; PARTIALLY SCOUTED 2026-05-29)
4th-order plant (L1, L2, coupling cap, Cout). Needs its own converging
controller. Analytical sizing is done and correct for CCM/CrCM; DCM needs the
`Le = L1‖L2` model (currently rejected in `calculate_inductance_dcm`).

**Scouting result — CCM SEPIC switching PtP is NOT achievable by damping +
tuning; needs DCM or a specialist compensator (do NOT repeat the dead end):**
Unlike totem-pole, the boost average-current loop CANNOT just be reused. A
genuine SEPIC power stage (L1, switch, Cc, L2, output diode, Cout) with the
boost controller driving the switch **converges numerically but does not
control** — the diagnosis is precise: `i_ref` tracks `|vin|` *perfectly* and the
voltage loop is steady; the sole failure is the input current `iL1` ringing on
the **Cc–L2 resonance** instead of following `i_ref`. This is a power-stage
stability problem, not a control-law problem.

A systematic ngspice sweep (~18 configs over 3 passes; helper
`/tmp/sweep_sepic.py`, throwaway) varied resonance placement (L2, Cc), the
Rd–Cd damper, the current-loop crossover, and added a physically-correct input
bridge diode. Steady-state (cycle-3) envelope NRMSE vs the `|sin|` reference:

| change | NRMSE |
|---|---|
| boost-loop reuse, L1=L2=1 mH, Cc=0.66 µF | 96.6 % |
| resonances pushed > fc_i (L2=0.2 mH, Cc=0.1 µF, fc_i=5 kHz) | 50 % |
| + smaller Cc=47 nF, fc_i=8 kHz | 32 % |
| + input bridge, Cc=33 nF, L2=0.1 mH, fc_i=12 kHz | **21.7 %** (floor) |

Clear monotonic trend: smaller Cc / higher fc_i help; lower fc_i hurts. But the
floor is ~22 %, reached at the edge of physical viability (Cc=33 nF pushes the
L2–Cc resonance up *near fsw*). **Damping + crossover tuning + input bridge
cannot meet the 10 % gate.** The Cc–L2 resonance fundamentally limits CCM
envelope tracking, and it *moves with Vin along the line cycle*, so a fixed
compensator notch is inherently imperfect. This is exactly why industry SEPIC
PFCs run in **DCM / boundary-conduction mode** (no CCM resonance).

**Conclusion / path forward:** do NOT ship a CCM SEPIC switching PtP (a ~22 %-
error circuit is the "half-working circuit" the handoff forbids). The valuable
SEPIC switching path is **DCM** — implement DCM sizing first (§2b → see Item 2 /
`calculate_inductance_dcm`), then a DCM/boundary switching PtP (resonance-free,
far more tractable). A CCM PtP would require a genuine resonance-canceling
compensator (gain-scheduled complex-zero pair tracking the moving resonance) —
a specialist multi-session project of low practical value. Also note:
`derive_pfc_controller_tuning` is boost-specific (Kp assumes `Vbus/(sL)`;
warm-start `ic_vc_i = 1−Vpk/Vbus` is the boost duty ~0.19 vs SEPIC's ~0.55) — a
SEPIC controller needs its own tuning path regardless.

**Analytical fix shipped alongside this scouting (2026-05-29):**
`process_operating_points` was synthesizing the SEPIC/Ćuk current waveform with
the BOOST duty `1−Vin/(Vout+Vd)` (line ~524) instead of the buck-boost duty
`(Vout+Vd)/(Vin+Vout+Vd)` — violating L1 volt-second balance and making the
synthesized peak current disagree with the (already-correct) diagnostic
`get_last_peak_inductor_current()`. Now topology-aware, matching
`simulate_and_extract_waveforms`. Guarded by
`Test_Pfc_SepicCuk_WaveformDutyConsistency`. Boost family unchanged
(byte-identical else-branch).

### 2c. Buck / buck-boost PFC
Different topology (discontinuous input current, inductor not in series with
the line). Low industry use. Only do if specifically needed.

### 2d. Vienna
3-phase, 3-level. Keep it a separate model (VIENNA_PLAN.md) — do NOT shoehorn
into the PFC variant branch; the code intentionally redirects.

## 3. ⚠️ Caveat the next agent must know: PtP bus-regulation gate is fragile

The PFC PtP bus-regulation gate (`TestPfcReferenceDesignsPtp.cpp`,
`run_ptp_gates`, "Gate 1") measures a **still-settling 3-cycle transient** —
the voltage loop crosses over at ~fline/5 (≈10 Hz) and barely corrects in 3
line cycles, so the bus mean sits ~5% below nominal (NCP1654 lands 379 V vs
400 V target, just inside ±6%). It is **hypersensitive to sub-percent L
shifts**: a 0.17% inductance change moved the bus mean 379→370 V (tripping
±6%). That's why the interleaved PtP pins its per-phase L to the reference
value (3.30 mH) rather than the model's 0.17%-different computed value.

If you tighten or extend PtP, the right levers are **more line cycles** (better
settling, slower) or **feed-forward in the controller** — not nudging the gate
tolerance. Don't "fix" a failing bus gate by loosening it.

---

## 4. Pre-existing issues observed (NOT introduced here — do not attribute)

- `Test_MagneticAdviser_Inductor_Only_Toroidal_Cores` (TestMagneticAdviser.cpp
  ~line 1325) fails on a clean baseline too (verified by reverting all my
  files). It's an interaction with the committed "reject ferrite toroids for
  energy-storing topologies" change (7b1517b5) and/or the uncommitted adviser
  work — an inductor forced onto toroidal cores that all get rejected.
- Running the **whole `[adviser]` suite together** shows ~tens of failures +
  an occasional SIGSEGV. This is documented test-isolation flakiness (`[!mayfail]`
  tags reference "global settings state when run after Buck/Boost tests") and
  reproduces on baseline. Use focused tags (`[pfc-topology]`,
  `[from-converter]`, `[forward-topology]`, `[converter-model]`) for signal.

---

## 5. Where things live

- Model: `src/converter_models/PowerFactorCorrection.{h,cpp}`
  - `validate_topology_variant()` — the per-variant gate (accept/throw).
  - `is_buck_boost_class()` (header) — SEPIC/Ćuk classifier.
  - `calculate_duty_cycle()` — topology-aware duty.
  - `calculate_inductance_{ccm,dcm,crcm}()` — sizing (DCM throws for SEPIC/Ćuk).
  - `generate_ngspice_switching_circuit()` — `switch(variant)` allows unipolar
    boost family; uses `per_phase_power` so interleaved emits one cell.
  - three synthesis loops (all topology-aware now).
- Controller: `PfcControllerDesign.{h,cpp}`, `PfcControllerSubcircuits.h`.
- Tests: `tests/TestTopologyPowerFactorCorrection.cpp` (analytical/variant),
  `tests/TestPfcSwitchingNetlist.cpp` (netlist well-formed/rejection),
  `tests/TestPfcReferenceDesignsPtp.cpp` (`[slow]` ngspice PtP, harness with
  `variant`/`phases` fields + per-phase gating).

## 6. Verification commands

```bash
ninja -C build -j5 MKF_tests        # always -j5
build/MKF_tests "[pfc-topology]"                 # 31 cases incl 6 slow PtP
build/MKF_tests "[pfc-topology]~[slow]"          # fast subset (25)
build/MKF_tests "[totem-pole]"                   # totem-pole netlist + PtP only
build/MKF_tests "[sepic-cuk]"                    # SEPIC/Ćuk sizing + duty consistency
build/MKF_tests "[converter-model]"              # 536 cases — shared-loop regression
build/MKF_tests "[pfc]"                          # PFC adviser path
```

All green as of this handoff: pfc-topology 31/31 (475 assertions, all 6 PtP
incl totem-pole), converter-model 536/536 (8415), pfc adviser 4/4.

## 7. Suggested next step
2a (totem-pole switching PtP) is **done**, and 2b (SEPIC/Ćuk) has been
**scouted** — see §2b for the dead end (boost-loop reuse gives 96.6 % envelope
NRMSE) and the concrete recipe to actually land it (SEPIC-aware compensator +
damping network + SEPIC-aware warm-start). 2b is now a well-scoped
controller-design session for whoever picks it up.

If switching-PtP isn't the priority, the highest-value PFC-adjacent work is the
analytical SEPIC/Ćuk **DCM sizing** (`Le = L1‖L2`, currently rejected in
`calculate_inductance_dcm`) — small, self-contained, and unblocks DCM SEPIC
designs. Outside PFC, the pre-existing `[adviser]`-suite isolation/segfault
flakiness and `Test_MagneticAdviser_Inductor_Only_Toroidal_Cores` baseline
failure (see §4) remain the biggest test-health items.
